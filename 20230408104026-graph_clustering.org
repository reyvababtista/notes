#+title: graph clustering

In computer vision, every pixel is a node and every edge is weighted by the
/affinity/ or similarity of the two nodes. We can generate several graphs:
1. fully connected (computationaly expensive)
2. neighboring pixels (fast, but only captures very local interactions)
3. local neighborhood (reasonably fast, graph is still very sparse, good tradeoff)
Then, we can convert the distance between two feature vectors into an affinity
(similarity) with the help of a generalized Gaussian kernel
