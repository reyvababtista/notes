#+title: Oura Daytime Stress feature

How might stress appear in your biometrics? A lower-than-usual HRV, for
instance, can indicate that your sympathetic nervous system is overworked.
Stress might also show up as a faster resting heart rate and higher respiratory
rate, indicating a rapid heartbeat and fast, shallow breathing — both of which
are features of a stress response.

Additionally, when exposed to stress, your peripheral body temperature (measured
at the base of your fingers), can dip. This is because the blood vessels in your
hands and fingers can constrict and reduce blood flow.
