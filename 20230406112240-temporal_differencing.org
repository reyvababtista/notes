#+title: temporal differencing

Rely on pixelwise differences between consecutive frames and do not maintain a
background model.
* Advantages
simple, fast, quick to adapt to different changes.
* Disadvantages
cannot detect slow moving or stopped objects without an explicit background
model. There is a foreground aperture problem (particularly large objects with
homogeneous interiors result in holes).

Only detect borders?
*Attention to variable types*. The sign cause problems/only partial detection.
