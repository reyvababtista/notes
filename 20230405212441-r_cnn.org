#+title: R-CNN

* Steps
1. Region proposals by [[id:57cb5cf7-e303-40c8-a020-3e351289b0b9][selective search]].
2. For each proposal, rescale and fed into [[id:751fb3ec-c511-471f-9d65-ba020a8f1f9d][Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)]] model trained on ImageNet to
   *extract features*.
3. Linear SVM classifiers are used to predict the presence of an object.

* Drawbacks
Redundant feature computations on a large number of overlapped proposals which
cause an extremely slow detection speed.

* Improvement
