#+title: convolution layer

Suppose we have an image of size 32x32x3 and a kernel of size 5x5x3. The
resulting activation map will be 28x28x1, based on the formula: input-(filter-1)

Total number of parameters would be: num of kernels x (WxHxD+1)

Properties:
1. Small number of parameters compared to the fully connected one.
2. Preserve spatial structure.
3. Translation equivariant: passing a translated image through a convolutional
   layer is (almost) equivalent to translating the convolution output (but be
   careful of image boundaries)
