#+title: YOLOv3

* Properties
1. Uses darknet-53 deep architecture (fully convolutional layers)
2. Makes detections at three different scales
3. Use 9 anchor boxes, three for each scale.
4. The upsampled layers concatenate with the previous layers, help preserve the
   fine grained features.

Properties 2 & 4 help address the issue of detecting small objects found in [[id:46bb2653-8cfc-4d07-a6aa-32c544f0848c][You
Only Look Once (YOLO)]] detector.

* Improvements
