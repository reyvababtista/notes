#+title: NN vs. CNN

NN:
1. Input is 1D vector
2. Neurons are fully connected
3. Layers: input, output, one or two hidden layers

[[id:751fb3ec-c511-471f-9d65-ba020a8f1f9d][Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)]]:
1. Input is 3D volume
2. Neurons are locally connected.
3. Higher number of hidden layers.
