#+title: moving object detection

Goal: segment moving regions from the rest of the image (background) to provide
focus of attention for later processes such as tracking, classification,
activity/action/behavior/event analysis.

Approaches:
1. Optical flow analysis: to detect changed regions using characteristics of
   flow (velocity) vectors of moving objects overtime, can be used in the presence
   of camera motions, but /computationally expensive/
2. [[id:001c869f-ca5f-4fdd-8df4-dfc0282e32eb][Temporal differencing]]: compute changes between consecutive frames, adaptive
   to dynamic environments, but has aperture problem.
3. [[id:aa0ce60f-d161-4739-8f51-21d91bbe9d84][Background substraction]]: uses the difference between the current frame and
   a reference background image, provides the most complete feature data, but
   sensitive to dynamic scence changes (e.g., lighting changes or extraneous events)
