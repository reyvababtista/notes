#+title: You Only Look Once (YOLO)

[[id:751fb3ec-c511-471f-9d65-ba020a8f1f9d][CNN]]-based.

* Steps
1. Apply a single network to the image.
2. Divide the image into regions and predict bounding boxes & probabilities
   for each region simultaneously.

* Drawbacks
It suffers from a drop of the localization accuracy compared to the two-stage
detectors (e.g., [[id:e840c4b3-e08a-40f9-85bd-b31e56e30473][Faster R-CNN]])

* Improvements
YOLOv3
