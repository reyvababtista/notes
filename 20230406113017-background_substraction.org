#+title: background substraction

Background with objects - background = moving objects. You need the
/[[id:60eb2d22-0232-4e34-9891-dd38c5c5972c][background models]]/.
* Advantages:
provides the most complete feature data, do not suffer from
foreground aperture problem, can detect slow moving or stopped objects.
* Disadvantages
sensitive to dynamic scene changes and extraneous events (i.e.,
uncovered background by removed objects)
* Usage:
traffic monitoring, human action recognition, human-computer interaction, object tracking
* Techniques:
[[id:dace6d1a-2c82-4b33-89e2-6be136cacf7b][Non-recursive]], [[id:7c32b7e2-ffd0-4df6-9d73-622b4ff561e6][recursive]], traditional methods (e.g., [[id:22065fe2-0fcf-459c-b4e9-5b2d53b7c554][median filter]], mean &
threshold, temporal derivative, mean & covariance)
