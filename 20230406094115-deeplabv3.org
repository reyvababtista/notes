* Properties:
1. It combines cascaded and parallel modules of dilated convolutions.
2. The parallel convolution modules are grouped in the ASPP. A 1 1 convolution
   and batch normalization are added in the ASPP.
3. All the outputs are concatenated and processed by another 1 1 convolution to
   create the final output with logits for each pixel.
