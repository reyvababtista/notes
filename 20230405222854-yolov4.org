* Properties
Composed of three parts: backbone, neck, and head.
1. *Backbone*: can be any pretrained [[id:751fb3ec-c511-471f-9d65-ba020a8f1f9d][CNN]]. Acts as the feature extraction network
   that computes feature maps from the input image.
2. *Neck*: connects the backbone and the head. Composed of spatial pyramid
   pooling (SPP) module and a path aggregation network (PAN). The neck
   concatenates the feature maps from different layers of the backbone network
   and sends them as inputs to the head.
3. *Head*: processes the aggregated features and predicts the bounding boxes,
   objectness scores, and classification scores.
