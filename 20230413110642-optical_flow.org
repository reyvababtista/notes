#+title: optical flow

You can use optical flow to segment images without the need of dataset as in
deep learning. Depths are the key to the segmentation layers.

Cannot use regular CNN because of multiple images & segmentation.

Ground truth for optical flow:
1. Silver ground truth using classical methods
2. Using syntethic data (see: Flying Chairs)
