#+title: RefineNet

It exploits various levels of detail at different stages of convolutions and
fuses them to obtain a high-resolution prediction without the need to maintain
large intermediate feature maps. Tries to solve the problems of classical CNN
(e.g., lose fine structures along the way) and dilated convolutions (e.g.,
computationally expensive).
