* Properties
1. Contribution of a new loss function called "focal loss". The loss reshapes
   the standard cross entropy loss so that detector will put more focus on hard,
   misclassified examples during training.
2. Backbone: [[id:225422c0-82bf-4d94-83f9-734aa7e31f5d][Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)]] on top of ResNet
3. Two subnetworks:
   1. Subnet-1 for classifying anchor boxes
   2. Subnet-2 for regressing from anchor boxes to ground-truth object boxes
