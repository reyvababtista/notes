#+title: hierarchical clustering

Two types:
1. [[id:9d4dd8b0-c6d9-41ae-8a8b-44c783ae824b][agglomerative (bottom up) clustering]]
2. [[id:42cc0668-fed4-4f5e-b6b6-1d55c49433da][divisive (top down) clustering]]

Three questions to answer:
1. How to represent a cluster of many points?
   1. Euclidean case: centroid
   2. Non-Euclidean case: clustroid (point closes to other points)
2. How to determine the nearness of the clusters?
   1. Euclidean case: measure distances by distances of centroids
   2. Non-euclidean case: treat clustroid as centroid, various distance measures
      between points of two clusters, various cohesion measures of the union of
      two clusters.
