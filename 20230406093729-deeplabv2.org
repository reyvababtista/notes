#+title: DeepLabV2

[[id:c5156666-3054-44e2-888f-a07dde9ddb75][DeepLab]] and DeepLabV2 are among the most popular image segmentation models.
DeepLabv2 has three key features:
1. Use of dilated convolution to address the decreasing resolution in the
   network caused by max-pooling and striding.
2. Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP), which probes an incoming convolutional
   feature layer with filters at multiple sampling rates, thus capturing objects
   as well as multiscale image context to robustly segment objects at multiple
   scales.
3. Improved localization of object boundaries by combining methods from deep
   CNNs, such as fully convolutional VGG-16 or ResNet 101, and probabilistic
   graphical models, specifically fully-connected CRFs.
