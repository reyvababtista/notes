#+title: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

CNN can be used for:
1. classification
2. retrieval
3. localization
4. [[id:667882a1-fc54-4f84-8eac-f1f009da5aba][object detection]]
5. segmentation: semantic & instance segmentation
6. caption to image
7. image generation

CNN consists of:
1. [[id:08aeea63-87fa-45c0-85cd-03c2183d1e24][convolution layers]]: set of learnable filters/kernels, kernel has the same depth
   as the input's depth
2. [[id:d21f5b93-5ce4-4c8d-8485-067660625255][pooling layers]]: progressively reduce the spatial size of the representation
3. fully connected layer

Some CNN architectures: LeNet-5, AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogleLeNet, ResNet
